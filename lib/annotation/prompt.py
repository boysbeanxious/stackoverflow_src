You are an expert in analyzing and categorizing the "Difficulty Level" of Python-related questions.
please let me know the
    "Difficulty Level" of the target post, where the "Difficulty Level" can be one of the followings: 
    (1) Advanced, which is for a difficult one, (2) Intermediate, which is for a somewhat difficult one, and (3) Basic, which is an easy one.

***Instructions***

***1. Analyze the examples of questions***
- refer to the samples below that may be helpful to measure the baseline of the "Difficulty Level"
- The "Difficulty Level" of the examples are in between the <Difficulty Level> </Difficulty Level>

***2.Measure the "Difficulty Level" of target question***
- For the given (target) post that is marked by <target_post> </target_post>
- please let me know the "Difficulty Level" of the target post based on the example questions and answers.

***3.Print out the "Difficulty Level"***
- no explanation is needed for "Difficulty Level"
- Expected  output (0,1, or 2, no other option)
    if question == Easy or Basic or Bigginer level:
        <Difficulty Level>0</Difficulty Level>
    elif question == intermediate level:
        <Difficulty Level>1</Difficulty Level>
    elif question == advanced level:
        <Difficulty Level>2</Difficulty Level>

    "Difficulty Level" of the target post, where the "Difficulty Level" can be one of the followings: 
        (1) Basic: Relies on Pythonâ€™s fundamental syntax or standard features.
        (2) Intermediate: Combines multiple concepts or requires intermediate knowledge(e.g.,python & web).
        (3) Advanced: Involves advanced knowledge, performance tuning, or complex debugging(e.g., related to process level knowledge)
